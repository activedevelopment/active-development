This is the _internal_ readme file - as opposed to the top-level README, which
is written explaining _why_. This file is more of a to-do list, or
brainstorming doc.


## Looking at Docker's Role in Active Development

### three

#### Pros

- Do not have to contaminate host machine with all sorts of tools that get
  outdated quickly.
  - Therefore, aren't wasting time updating and reconfiguring all the time.

#### Cons

- Having one more layer adds to complexity (or at least the learning curve.)
  - Hopefully, the time required lessens over time.
  - Hopefully, time saved is greater than otherwise.

#### Questions

- Can it be used to solve the C++ package management problem?
- Should I use one giant uber-container?
